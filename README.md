## What this is

OpenDiscover BioLab is a **virtual biotechnology laboratory** you can run in a browser and drive with AI. It has three layers that build on each other:

1. **A library of deterministic simulation engines** covering the breadth of computational biology — molecular biology, protein biophysics, systems biology, population genetics, bioprocess engineering, epidemiology, and drug discovery. Every engine is a *pure function*: no clock, no network, no unseeded randomness. Same inputs → same outputs → same content hash, on every machine.

2. **Autonomous AI scientist agents** that use those engines as instruments. Given a research goal, an agent forms a falsifiable hypothesis, designs and runs parameter-swept experiments, reads the numbers, iterates, and writes up an honest report — journalling every step in a transparent lab notebook.

3. **A citizen-science discovery pipeline** (the original OpenDiscover engine) that screens, scores, and vulgarizes promising results into shareable Discovery Cards, with peer review, canary replication, and open archival.

> **The core idea:** because every experiment is deterministic and hashed, an AI-run experiment is exactly as reproducible and trustworthy as a human-run one. That is what lets a *swarm* of autonomous agents systematically explore biology at a throughput no wet lab can match — without giving up rigor.

## The simulation engines

Each engine ships with a Zod-validated parameter schema, a worked example, literature references, and a test suite that checks its output against **known analytical or textbook values** — not just "it runs".

## Streamers & creators

Because every run is deterministic, **any experiment is already a shareable link** — the whole
lab is built to be streamed, shared, and remixed with no account and no infrastructure.

- **🔗 Share & remix permalinks.** Every engine playground has a **Share / Remix** button that packs
  the exact engine + parameters into a `?x=` link. Whoever opens it reproduces your run
  byte-for-byte (same numbers, same content hash), then tweaks a value and re-shares their remix.
  The link is self-contained — nothing is uploaded or stored server-side.
- **🎯 Daily challenge — [`/challenge`](./src/app/challenge).** One puzzle a day, derived purely from
  the date, so it's the *same for everyone on Earth* with no server and no RNG. Tune one parameter,
  beat the target, and share your best attempt as a normal `?x=` link. A ready-made "today's episode"
  hook for a stream. Your personal best is stored locally in your browser — no global leaderboard.
- **🖼️ Rich social cards.** Every engine page and every shared run unfurls into a branded
  1200×630 Open Graph image. A shared `?x=` link shows the engine, its headline metric, and the
  reproducibility hash — so links dropped in Discord/X/Twitch chat look alive.
- **📺 OBS overlay mode.** Append `/overlay` to any engine link —
  `/lab/<engine>/overlay?x=<token>` — for a transparent, chrome-less, big-type result card that
  auto-runs on load. Add it as a **Browser Source** in OBS (1920×1080, transparent background) and
  your stream shows live engine output with its hash as proof. The **📺 OBS overlay** button in the
  playground builds the URL for you.
- **🖼️ Community gallery — [`/gallery`](./src/app/gallery).** A curated, credited collection of
  interesting runs. Each opens in the Lab in one click. Adding yours is a **one-file pull request**
  (see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)); a build-time check validates every entry against its
  engine's schema, so a broken run can never merge.

## The autonomous scientist

```ts
import { runCampaign } from '@/lib/lab/scientist';

const outcome = await runCampaign({
  goal: 'Find a chemostat dilution rate that maximizes steady-state product '
      + 'productivity for a Monod organism with µmax=0.9/h, Ks=0.2 g/L.',
  engineScope: ['bioreactor'],
  runBudget: 20,
});

console.log(outcome.report.conclusion);
console.log(outcome.notebookMarkdown); // full transparent reasoning trail
```

The agent (Claude Opus, via the Vercel AI Gateway) works through a **contained tool set** — `list_engines`, `describe_engine`, `run_experiment`, `run_sweep`, `record_finding`. It never touches an engine directly, so every action it takes is a hashed, replayable experiment recorded in the notebook. Its final output is a structured report: hypothesis, evidence-backed findings, surprises, an honest conclusion, and suggested follow-ups.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install

# 1. Run the simulation engines — no secrets, no database needed
pnpm test                       # every engine, checked against known values

# 2. Full platform (discovery pipeline + lab UI)
cp .env.example .env.local      # fill in DATABASE_URL + AI Gateway key
pnpm db:push                    # push schema to Postgres
pnpm dev                        # Next.js + Inngest dev server
```

The engines have **zero runtime dependencies** on secrets — you can `import` and run any of them, or `pnpm test`, immediately after install. The AI scientist and discovery pipeline need the AI Gateway + Postgres configured.

## Project status — what's actually verified

Honesty about what has and hasn't been run for real:

**Verified, hands-on:**
- All 32 engines + the lab layer: **770+ tests pass**, checked against known analytical/textbook values, run in CI with zero secrets (`engines` job).
- `pnpm build` succeeds — a real Next.js production build, with **no database and no secrets configured** (CI's `build` job runs it with a placeholder, unreachable `DATABASE_URL` to prove this). API routes that read live data are explicitly `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` so they're never executed at build time.
- `pnpm dev` + real HTTP requests against the running server confirm `/lab`, `/lab/breeding`, and `/lab/[engine]` render actual content, and `POST /api/lab/run` returns correct, live-computed results (e.g. a `breeding` cross returning the exact 3:1 Mendelian ratio).
- `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` (Biome) are both clean.

**Not verified (needs infrastructure this repo doesn't provision):**
- The discovery pipeline, peer review, DOI minting, auth, and the autonomous `runCampaign` scientist agent all need a real Postgres + pgvector instance and a Vercel AI Gateway key — neither is running against this codebase yet. The code compiles and is typed against real schemas, but its runtime behavior with live data is unverified.
- No load testing, no security audit, no production deployment yet.

**Scientific accuracy — models, not lab results.** Every engine reproduces the textbook/analytical case it's tested against, but several use documented simplifications rather than state-of-the-art methods: see each engine's `references` and the caveats noted in its test file (e.g. the ADMET logP is a crude atom-contribution estimate, not a calibrated model; CRISPR on/off-target scoring is a documented heuristic, not the trained Doench/CFD models; HP lattice folding is a teaching model, not a real force field). Treat outputs as illustrative, not as a substitute for wet-lab or peer-reviewed computational results.

All 20 pre-existing engines went through an independent scientific-accuracy audit (each checked against its own cited references) that found and fixed **real, verifiable bugs** — not just wording. Highlights: `admet`'s TPSA fragment classifier miscounted ether/amine oxygens as carbonyls (aspirin's TPSA silently read 71.4 instead of the correct 63.6 Å²); `bioreactor`'s chemostat steady-state formula was applied at D=0, a genuine mathematical singularity, instead of the true closed-batch limit; `breeding` corrupted any multi-character allele symbol (e.g. an ABO-style locus) through a lossy string-splitting round-trip; `compartmental`'s SIR peak-prevalence formula was applied even when the effective reproduction number R₀·s₀ ≤ 1, where the epidemic never actually peaks. Every fix shipped with a regression test that fails on the old code and passes on the new. Full detail in each engine's `changesSummary` is in the commit history.

## Why deterministic?

Reproducibility is the whole thesis. Every engine run is canonically hashed (stable key order, no whitespace). Re-running the same engine with the same params anywhere reproduces the same `outputHash`. This means:

- **AI experiments are auditable** — the notebook records exactly what was run; anyone can replicate it.
- **Canary replication works** — a promoted result is automatically re-run in an isolated Vercel Sandbox; a hash mismatch flags the engine.
- **Stochastic models stay reproducible** — every random draw comes from a seeded PRNG (`sim/core/prng`), never `Math.random()`.

## Contributing

New engines are welcome — a good engine is pure, documented, and tested against a known result. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [engine authoring guide](./SIMULATION_ENGINES.md#authoring-an-engine).

## Safety

In-silico results are **models, not clinical or applied claims**. Submissions pass a two-layer dual-use screen. See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).
